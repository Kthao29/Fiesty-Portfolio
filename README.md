# Professional Portfolio

## The purpose of this challenge is to build my professional portfolio. By looking at this portfolio, employers can grasp my skills level in coding and see if I am the candidate they are looking for. I learned that creating a website from scratch can be a fun but frustrating challenge but I have picked up a lot of skills in the midst of this. I have learned how to better use elements and how to apply what I learned in the course.
